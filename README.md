# Pokemons Test Job

Simple app displaying a list of pokemons. Tapping specific pokemon opens a screen with additional details.

## Requirements
* UIKit
* Pokemon list pagination
* iOS 13+
* iPhone-only

## Tech Stack
* MVP architecture
* Alamofire and Kingfisher for accessing and caching network resources
*  Reusable and TinyConstraints as utility libraries
*  API: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2
*  For the sake of simplicity, it's been decided to use User Defaults for storing favorite pokemons' IDs for now, as the data is simple and not considered private.

## Notes
Landscape orientation, dark mode and primitive dynamic text adaptations are provided.
